# ON-CHIP-Dual-Address-ROM-Design-
The Verilog code can be realized either by using the register array, ‘reg mem’ or by the ‘case’ statements. We will use the ‘case’ statements in ‘always’ block as shown in the Verilog code since double address is easy to handle in the case statement approach. To begin with, adequate explanation of how the ROM is organized is furnished as comment
